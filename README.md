This app functions as a community message board, where users can post messages, delete their own posts, interact with others' posts by liking them, and create high-priority posts to draw special attention to a particular message or topic. By providing these tools, the app offers a dynamic platform for users to engage with one another and share information.

## Goals
Gain familiarity with CRUD operations, Node.js/Express, MongoDB, sending server requests, and become proficient with EJS templates. I was particularly interested in learning more about MongoDB's document-based data storage and how it differs from traditional relational databases.

## Results
By working with MongoDB, I was able to better understand how to store and retrieve data in a non-relational database. I also gained experience in using MongoDB's query language to interact with the data and perform CRUD operations.
